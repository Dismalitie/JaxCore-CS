# JaxCore-CS

JaxCore-CS is a project that I'm working on to rewrite [JaxCore](https://jaxcore.app/) in C# with Visual Studio - and yes I have permission.

Build in VS or get executable from [here](https://github.com/Dismalitie/JaxCore-CS/tree/main/bin/Debug) - **NOT JUST THE EXE, DOWNLOAD THE WHOLE FOLDER**
