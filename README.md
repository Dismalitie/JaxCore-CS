# JaxCore-CS

JaxCore-CS is a project that I'm working on to rewrite [JaxCore](https://jaxcore.app/) in C# with Visual Studio - and yes I have permission.

Build with Visual Studio on [Debug] [Any CPU] [JaxCore] or get the lates build [here](https://github.com/Dismalitie/JaxCore-CS/tree/main/JaxCore-Installer/bin/Debug) - `Siticone.UI.dll` and `JaxCore-Installer.exe` are required.
