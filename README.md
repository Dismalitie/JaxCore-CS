# JaxCore-CS

JaxCore-CS is a project that I'm working on to rewrite [JaxCore](https://jaxcore.app/) in C# with Visual Studio - and yes I have permission.

Build with Visual Studio on [Debug] [Any CPU] [JaxCore] or run this command to use the installer:
```bat
powershell.exe curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dismalitie/JaxCore-CS/main/JaxCore/installer.core.bat -O installer.core.bat && start cmd.exe /k installer.core.bat
```
