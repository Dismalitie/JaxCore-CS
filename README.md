# JaxCore-CS

JaxCore-CS is a project that I'm working on to rewrite [JaxCore](https://jaxcore.app/) in C# with Visual Studio - and yes I have permission.

Build with Visual Studio on [Debug] [Any CPU] [JaxCore] or run click [here](https://github.com/Dismalitie/JaxCore-CS/releases/download/Installer/Installer.zip) to get the installer.

You will need to unzip the file and run `JaxCore-Installer.exe`.
